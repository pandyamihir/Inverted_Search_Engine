# Inverted_Search_Engine
This project implements an efficient inverted index using hashing. It first builds a forward index (word â†’ documents) and inverts it for fast lookups. The hash-based design ensures O(1) average insertion and query times, enabling scalable text search for search engines and document retrieval systems by mapping words to their document locations.
